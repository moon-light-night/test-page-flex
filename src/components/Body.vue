          Your life is a dash between your dates of birth and death.<br />
          We are free to fill it ourselves. Our mistake is that we think we
          still have a lot of time, but it isn't so.<br />
          You. Are. Mortal...<br />
          And as soon as this awareness settles down in your head, you will
          understand what is important to you and what is dust.
